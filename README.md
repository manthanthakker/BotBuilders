## Common Scenario: Voice Assistant

Pre-req: OpenAI-Subscription - Key

The assistant will greet you and start listening to your input via microphone. You can ask it any question or give it any command, and it will use GPT-3 API to process your input and generate a response.

To exit the voice assistant, simply say "exit" or "bye".

## Future Work

Some ideas for future work include:

- Adding more features and capabilities to the voice assistant
- Improving the accuracy and responsiveness of the speech recognition and GPT-3 API integration
- Adding more advanced natural language processing capabilities, such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition
